// MBCs
// As the Game Boyâ€™s 16-bit address bus offers only limited space for ROM and RAM
// addressing, many games are using Memory Bank Controllers (MBCs) to expand the
// available address space by bank switching. These MBC chips are located in the
// game cartridge (that is, not in the Game Boy itself). In each cartridge, the
// required (or preferred) MBC type should be specified in the byte at $0147 of
// the ROM, as described in the cartridge header.
